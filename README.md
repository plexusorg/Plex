# Plex [![Build Status](https://ci.plex.us.org/job/Plex/job/master/badge/icon)](https://ci.plex.us.org/job/Plex/job/master/) ![CodeQL](https://github.com/plexusorg/Plex/workflows/CodeQL/badge.svg)

Plex is a new freedom plugin. It is an alternative to TotalFreedomMod. It has many of the features that make a freedom
server unique, but also many features that TotalFreedomMod doesn’t have. For example, there is full support for using a
permissions plugin instead of ranks. It is also much more performance oriented. You can use Redis to store indefinite
bans and store player data in MongoDB, MariaDB, or SQLite. Plex is also fully customizable as you can change almost all
of the messages within the plugin. Plex also has a module system which can be used to add additional functionality. Plex
is not a rewrite, "debloat", or related to TotalFreedomMod. Plex is an entirely new experience.
